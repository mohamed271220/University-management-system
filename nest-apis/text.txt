🚀 Completion of My University Management System’s REST API with Express & NestJS! 🚀

I’m thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the REST API for my University Management System—a project designed to revolutionize the educational experience for students, professors, staff, and administrators. As a major milestone, I have also recreated this API using NestJS for enhanced performance and scalability!

🔍 Project Overview:
- Role-Based Authentication: Secure and tailored access for admins, students, professors, and staff.
- Dynamic Timetable Generation: Automatic creation of schedules for students, professors, departments, and halls.
- Course and Enrollment Management: Seamless enrollment tracking, with automated checks for prerequisites.
- Attendance and Grading: Professors can track attendance and assign grades directly.
- Lecture and Department Tracking: Detailed records for efficient management.
- Password Reset: Secure and user-friendly password reset functionality.

💻 Technical Highlights:
- Express & TypeScript: Initially built on a robust, scalable platform.
- NestJS: Recreated the API for better structure and maintainability.
- JWT Authentication: Secure user sessions with role-based permissions.
- Swagger & Docker: Comprehensive API documentation and consistent deployment.
- Redis Caching: Optimized performance for high user loads.
- Docker Setup: Set up Docker and Docker Compose for seamless development and deployment.

📊 NestJS vs. Express:
- Express: A minimalist, flexible framework providing robust features and control.
- NestJS: A progressive framework with strong architectural conventions for maintainability and scalability.

🛠️ Challenges Overcome:
- Implemented a complex role-based system balancing security and flexibility.
- Developed sophisticated logic for dynamic timetable generation.
- Optimized performance using Redis caching.

💡 Lessons Learned:
This project has deepened my expertise in TypeScript, Docker, Redis, API design, and transitioning from Express to NestJS. Building the same project with two different frameworks has provided invaluable insights into their strengths and best use cases.
