🚀 Completion of My University Management System’s REST API with Express & NestJS! 🚀

I’m thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the REST API for my University Management System—a project designed to revolutionize the educational experience for students, professors, staff, and administrators. As a major milestone, I have also recreated this API using NestJS for enhanced performance and scalability!

🔍 Project Overview:
- Role-Based Authentication: Secure and tailored access for admins, students, professors, and staff, ensuring everyone interacts with the system relevant to their role.
- Dynamic Timetable Generation: Automatic creation of schedules for students, professors, departments, and halls, preventing conflicts and enhancing organization.
- Course and Enrollment Management: Seamless course enrollment tracking, with automated checks for prerequisites and other requirements.
- Attendance and Grading: Professors can track attendance and assign grades directly, with secure and role-based access.
- Lecture and Department Tracking: Detailed records of lectures and department activities for efficient management.
- Password Reset: Secure and user-friendly password reset functionality.

💻 Technical Highlights:
- Express & TypeScript: Initially built on a robust, scalable platform with strong typing and object-oriented principles.
- NestJS: Recreated the API using NestJS for better structure and maintainability.
- JWT Authentication: Secure user sessions with finely tuned role-based permissions.
- Swagger Documentation & Docker: Comprehensive API documentation and consistent deployment across environments.
- Redis Caching: Implemented Redis to optimize performance and handle high user loads efficiently.
- Docker & Docker Compose: Set up Docker and Docker Compose for the Express API to ensure seamless development, testing, and deployment across different environments.

📊 NestJS vs. Express:
- Express: A minimalist, flexible framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Ideal for developers who prefer to have more control and flexibility over their project structure and middleware.
- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework that uses TypeScript by default and incorporates strong architectural conventions. It provides a built-in module system, dependency injection, and a more opinionated structure that enhances maintainability and scalability.

🛠️ Challenges Overcome:
- Implemented a complex role-based system balancing security and flexibility.
- Developed sophisticated logic for dynamic timetable generation.
- Optimized performance to handle large user loads using Redis caching.

🌟 Additional Features:
- Password Reset: Added a secure and user-friendly password reset feature.
- Full Documentation: Ensured comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints.
- Docker Setup: Implemented Docker and Docker Compose for streamlined development and deployment processes.

💡 Lessons Learned:
This project has deepened my expertise in TypeScript, Docker, Redis, API design, and transitioning from Express to NestJS. The experience of building the same project with two different frameworks has provided invaluable insights into the strengths and best use cases for each framework.
